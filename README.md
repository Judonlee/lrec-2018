# Requirements
1. You must install all requirements in requirements file
2. [You must download and unzip  the Godin word embeddings](http://yuca.test.iminds.be:8900/fgodin/downloads/word2vec_twitter_model.tar.gz) 
and store the 'word2vec_twitter_model.bin' file in the 'resources/pre_trained_models/' directory.
3. You will need to download all tweets into Semeval and Waseem json files via the Twitter API.  A useful library is [Tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/)

+ Use the 'tweet_id' field in each JSON file to fetch the tweet text from the Twitter API
+ Store the text into corresponding 'text' field and then save to JSON file with same name and path
+ Waseem JSON file is found in: 'resources/hate_speech_corps'
+ Semeval JSON files (5 total) are found in: 'resources/sem_eval_tweets/SemEval'
+ NOTE: Twitter authors have the right to remove their posts from Twitter, as such, it is likely you will not retrieve all tweets in these files.  It is suggested that you remove any entries with tweets not fetched from the json files before running any code.
